   <h1><strong>Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder</strong></h1>
   <hr>
   <p><strong>Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)</strong> is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by symptoms of inattention, hyperactivity, impulsivity, and emotional dysregulation that are excessive and pervasive, impairing in multiple contexts, and developmentally inappropriate. ADHD symptoms arise from executive dysfunction.

    Impairments resulting from deficits in self-regulation such as time management, inhibition, task initiation, and sustained attention[19] can include poor professional performance, relationship difficulties, and numerous health risks,[20][21] collectively predisposing to a diminished quality of life[22] and a reduction in life expectancy.[23][24] It is associated with other mental disorders as well as non-psychiatric disorders, which can cause additional impairment.[8] The disorder costs society hundreds of billions of US dollars each year, worldwide.[25]</p>

<h2>Signs and symptoms</h2>
<hr>
<p>Inattention, hyperactivity (restlessness in adults), disruptive behaviour, and impulsivity are common in ADHD.[52][53][54] Academic difficulties are frequent, as are problems with relationships.[53][54][55] The signs and symptoms can be difficult to define, as it is hard to draw a line at where normal levels of inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity end and significant levels requiring interventions begin.[56]</p>

<h3>Presentations</h3>
<p>ADHD is divided into three primary presentations:</p>
<ul>
    <li>predominantly inattentive (ADHD-PI or ADHD-I)</li>
    <li>predominantly hyperactive-impulsive (ADHD-PH or ADHD-HI)</li>
    <li>combined presentation (ADHD-C).</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The table <strong>"Symptoms"</strong> lists the symptoms for ADHD-I and ADHD-HI from two major classification systems. Symptoms which can be better explained by another psychiatric or medical condition which an individual has are not considered to be a symptom of ADHD for that person. In DSM-5, subtypes were discarded and reclassified as presentations of the disorder that change over time.</p>
